ðŸ”“ Huawei Bootloader Breaker

A brute-force script designed to unlock Huawei device bootloaders via fastboot â€” one code at a time.

This tool attempts to find the correct OEM unlock code by automatically sending sequential fastboot commands using a starting point (default or custom). It's useful for older Huawei devices where official bootloader unlock codes are no longer available.

Features:

    Works via "fastboot oem unlock <code>"

    Starts from a default code (1000000000000000) or a custom one via CLI argument

    No file creation, no bloat â€” just pure brute-force

    Clean loop with real-time output

Usage:

    On Linux / macOS: python3 Bootloader-Breaker.py 

    On Windows (if Python is installed): python Bootloader-Breaker.py 

You can interrupt the script at any time with Ctrl + C.
The script will stop immediately without saving the last tried code â€” this is by design to keep it lightweight.

This tool is intended for educational and personal use only.

Brute-forcing a bootloader may:

    Void your warranty

    Permanently brick your device
